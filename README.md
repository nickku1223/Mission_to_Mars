# Purpose of this project
This project is about web scraping, using programming language (in this case Python) to create a automated program to gather information from the webpage.

This project also introduced some structure of a webpage, how to find the information within the webpage's html code, basic layout and to customize the page with Bootstrap3. And we use Python, and the BeautifulSoup module, Splinter module and other modules to create an automated web scraping page, with a button which we can simply click and get the latest data from the target page.

This project also introduce MongoDB, which is a non-relational database. Information from web sraping often don't have clean, neat structure like the data in spreadsheet or SQL, often have mixed of text, link, images, etc. And non-relational database will be great to store this kind of data.
