# Purpose of this project
This project is about web scraping, using a programming language (in this case Python) to create an automated program to gather information from the webpage.

This project also introduced some structures of a webpage, how to find the information within the webpage's HTML code, basic layout, and to customize the page with Bootstrap3. And we use Python, the BeautifulSoup module, the Splinter module, and other modules to create an automated web scraping page, with a button that we can simply click and get the latest data from the target page.

This project also introduces MongoDB, which is a non-relational database. Information from web scraping often don't have a clean, neat structure like the data in a spreadsheet or SQL, and often have mixed text, link, images, etc. And non-relational database will be great to store this kind of data.
